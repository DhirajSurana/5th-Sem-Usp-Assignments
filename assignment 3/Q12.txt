/*
Q12. Let p be a pointer to an integer array and n is a scalar value. State the significance of the statement
     p+n.
*/
As per pointer arithmetic p+n will give the memory address = p+n*(2)

example:  if p = 222 and n = 4
          then p + n = 222 + 4 * 2
                     = 222 + 8
                     = 230
